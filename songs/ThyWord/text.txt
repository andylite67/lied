Vers 1
When I feel afraid, think of lost my way,
Still you´re there right beside me.
Nothing will I fear, as long as you are near,
Please, be near me to the end.

Thy word is a lamp
unto my feet
and a light unto my path.

Vers 2
I will not forget, your love for me and jet,
My heart forever is wondering
Jesus be my guide, hold me to your side
And  I will love you to the end.

Thy word is a lamp
unto my feet
and a light unto my path.
(2x)
