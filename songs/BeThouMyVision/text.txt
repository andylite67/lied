Vers 1
Be thou my vision, O Lord of my heart,
naught be all else to me, save that thou art,
Thou my best thought, by day or by night,
waking or sleeping, Thy presence my light.


Vers 2
Be thou my wisdom and Thou my true word,
I ever with Thee and Thou with me Lord,
Thou my great Father, I Thy true son,
Thou in me dwelling and I with Thee one.


Vers 3
Riches I heed not nor man's empty praise,
Thou my inheritance now and always,
Thou and Thou only first in my heart,
High King of heaven my treasure Thou art.


Vers 4
High King of heaven my victory won,
may I reach heaven's joy, O bright heaven's sun!
Heart of my own heart, whatever befall.
Still be my vision, O ruler of all.

Still be my vision, O ruler of all.
