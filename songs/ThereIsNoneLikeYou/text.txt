There is none like You,
no one else can touch my heart like You do;
I could search for all eternity long
and find there is none like You.


Your mercy flows like a river wide
and healing comes from Your hands.
Suffering children are safe in Your arms,
there is none like You.


There is none like You,
no one else can touch my heart like You do;
I could search for all eternity long
and find there is none like You.


Your mercy flows like a river wide
and healing comes from Your hands.
Suffering children are safe in Your arms,
there is none like You.
