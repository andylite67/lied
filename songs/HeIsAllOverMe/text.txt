He is up in my head and is keeping me alive,
keeping me alive, keeping me allive,
He is up in my head and is keeping me alive,
Jesus is keeping me alive.

He is down in my heart and is keeping me alive,
keeping me alive, keeping me alive,
He is down in my heart and is keeping me alive,
Jesus is keeping me alive.
