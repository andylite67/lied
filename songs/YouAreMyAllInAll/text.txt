Vers 1
You are my strength when I am weak,
You are the treasure that I seek,
you are my all in all.
Seeking You as a precious jewel,
Lord to give up I´d be a fool
You are my all in all.

Jesus, lamb of god,
worthy is your name.
Jesus, lamb of god,
worthy is your name.


Refrain
Jesus, lamb of god,
worthy is your name.
Jesus, lamb of god,
worthy is your name.


Vers 2
Taking my sin, my cross, my shame,
rising again I bless your name,
you are my all in all.
When I fall down, you  pick me up.
When I am dry, you fill my cup.
You are my all in all.

Jesus, lamb of god,
worthy is your name.
Jesus, lamb of god,
worthy is your name.


Refrain
Jesus, lamb of god,
worthy is your name.
Jesus, lamb of god,
worthy is your name.
