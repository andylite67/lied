Vers 1
Amazing Grace, how sweet the sound,
that saved a wretch like me -
I once was lost but now am found,
was blind, but now, I see.

TŽwas Grace that taught my heart to fear.
And Grace, my fears relieved.
How Presious did that Grace appear
the hour I first believe.

Through many dangers, toils and snares
we have already come.
TŽwas Grace that brought us safe thus far
and Grace will lead us home.


Vers 4
The Lord has promised good to me
his word my hope secures.
He will my shield and portion be
as long as life endurs.


Vers 5
When weŽve been there ten thousand years
bright shining as the sun.
WeŽve no less days to sing God`s praise
then when weŽve first begun.


Vers 6
Amazing Grace, how sweet the sound,
that saved a wretch like me
I once was lost but now am found,
was blind, but now, I see.
