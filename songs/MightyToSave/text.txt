Vers 1
Everyone needs compassion
Love that's never failing Let mercy fall on me
everyone needs forgiveness
The kindness of a savior the hope of nations

Savior he can move the mountains
My God is mighty to save he is mighty to save

He rose and conquered the grave
Jesus conquered the grave.

So take me as you find me
all my fears and failures
Fill my life again I give my life to follow
Everything I believe in Now I Surrender

My God is mighty to save he is mighty to save
Forever Author of Salvation
He rose and conquered the grave
Jesus conquered the grave.
