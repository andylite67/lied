Vers 1
I may not be rich. Don't wear fancy clothes.
And I don't live in a mansion.
Don't have too much to show.
Never won a contest in popularity.
And I don't have much to offer.
But Jesus still loves me.


Refrain
‘Cause I'm accepted,
I’m accepted.
I am accepted by the One who matters most.


Vers 2
I never set a record in sports ability.
And I never was magnetic in personality.
But it really doesn’t matter.
I'll do the best I can.
'Cause there's a God above me.
Who loves me as I am.


Refrain
‘Cause I'm accepted,
I’m accepted.
I am accepted by the One who matters most.


Bridge
If you think that you're a failure.
When you don’t succeed at everything you do.
Oh Just remember that God is your Saviour.
And you are worth enough.
He gave His life for you.


Refrain
Now you are accepted, you are accepted.
You are accepted by the One
You are accepted, you are accepted.
You are accepted by the One who matters most.
