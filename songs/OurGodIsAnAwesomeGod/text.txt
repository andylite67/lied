Vers 1
When He rolls up His sleeves
He ain´t just putting on the ritz,
our God is an awesome God.
There´s thunder in His footsteps
and lightning in His fists,
Our God is an awesome God.


Vers 1
And the Lord He wasn´t joking
when He kicked ´em out of Eden,
it wasn´t for no reason
that He shed His blood.
His return is very close
and so You better be believin´ that:
Our God is an awesome God.


Refrain
Our God is an awesome God,
He reigns from heaven above
with wisdom, power and love,
our God is an awesome God.


Vers 2
And when the sky was starless
in the void of the night,
our God is an awesome God.
He spoke into the darkness
and created the light,
our God is an awesome God.


Vers 2
The judgment and wrath
He poured out on Sodom,
the mercy and grace
He gave us at the cross.
I hope that we have
not too quickly forgotten,
that our God is an awesome God.


Refrain
Our God is an awesome God,
He reigns from heaven above
with wisdom, power and love,
our God is an awesome God.
