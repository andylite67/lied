Got a reason for living again,
got a reason for laughing again,
got a reason for loving again.
I´ve got the love of God in my heart!


No reason to cry anymore,
no reason to sigh anymore,
no reason to die anymore,
I´ve got the love of God in my heart!


Boys - Girls

Monday, I was all alone.
Tuesday, I had my sins to atone.
Wednesday, I cried and cried.
Thursday, I thought I would die.


Girls - Boys

Monday, I was all alone.
Tuesday, I had my sins to atone.
Wednesday, I cried and cried.
Thursday, I thought I would die.


Friday, I started to pray.
Saturday, I read my bible all day,
but Sunday, Lord, the heavens did part.
I´ve got the love of God in my heart!
