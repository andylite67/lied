Vers 1
You're the God of this city.
You're the King of these people
You're the Lord of this nation. You are.


Vers 2
You’re the light in this darkness.
You’re the hope to the hopeless
You’re the peace to the restless. You are
There is no one like our God
There is no one like our God


Refrain
Greater things have yet to come
Greater things are still to be done in this city
Greater things have yet to come
Greater things are still to be done here.
