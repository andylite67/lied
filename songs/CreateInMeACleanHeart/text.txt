Create in me a clean heart, o God,
and renew a right spirit within me.
Create in me a clean heart, o God,
and renew a right spirit within me.


And cast me not away
from Thy presence, o Lord,
and take not thy Holy Spirit from me.
Restore unto me
the joy of Thy salvation
and renew a right spirit within me.
