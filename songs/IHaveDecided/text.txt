Vers
I have decided. I'm gonna make a stand.
I have decided. I'm taking back my land.
I have decided this far and no more.
I'm gonna take up the sword and
fight in the name of the lord.


Refrain
Jesus, Lord of Lords Jesus, Almighty King.
Jesus, the Lion of Judah.
Jesus, Lord of Lords Jesus, Almighty King.
Jesus, the Lion of Judah.


Bridge
We wrestle not with flesh and with blood,
but powers and principalities.
We wrestke not with eachother's love
but demonic forces in the heavenlies
