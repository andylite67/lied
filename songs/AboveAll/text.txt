Vers 1
Above all powers, above all kings,
above all nature and all created things;
above all wisdom and all the ways of man,
You were here before the world began.


Vers 2
Above all kingdoms, above all thrones,
above all wonders the world has ever known;
above all wealth and treasures of the earth,
there´s no way to measure what You´re worth.


Refrain
Crucified, laid behind the stone;
You lived to die, rejected and alone;
like a rose trampled on the ground,
You took the fall and thought of me, above all.
