Vers 1
Jesus Christ, I think upon your sacrifice.
You became nothing, poured out to death.
Many times,
I´ve wondered at Your gift of life,
and I´m in that place once again,
I´m in that place once again.


Refrain
And once again I look upon
the cross where You died.
I´m humbled by Your mercy
and I´m broken inside.
Once again I thank You,
once again I pour out my life.


Vers 2
Now You are exalted to the highest place,
King of the heavens, where one day I bow.
But for now I marvel on this saving grace,
and I´m full of praise once again.
I´m full of praise once again.


Refrain
And once again I look upon
the cross where You died.
I´m humbled by Your mercy
and I´m broken inside.
Once again I thank You,
once again I pour out my life.
