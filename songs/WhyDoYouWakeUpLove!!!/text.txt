Why do you wake up love my beloved 
one before comes the time ? (bis)
The primroses of our garden will bloom 
to perfume the palace .


The palm trees like sentinels will stand 
up for the retirement of spouses ,
Why do u wake up love my beloved 
one before comes the time ?
Ooh it`s the nostalgia from heaven 
that falls over me ,


It`s like this whirlwind that took Elijah , 
let´s go for our honeymoon my beloved one ,
Remove that ebony mask , 
rest and your dove will coos for you.
I press the fruit of makore for your beauty 
this oil will anoint your hair, 


I will scot throughout our home to offer 
you a bed of ivory.
Why do you wake love my beloved one
