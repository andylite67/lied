Great is the Lord, he is holy and just
By his power we trust in his love.
Great is the Lord he is faithful and true
By his mercy he proves He is love.

Great is the Lord and worthy of glory
Great is the Lord and worthy of praise
Great is the Lord now lift up your voice
now lift up your voice:
Great is the lord Great is the lord
