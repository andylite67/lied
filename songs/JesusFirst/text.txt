Vers 1
Yes, I believe You're the Christ my authority
And yes, I believe that You are Lord
No others gods - You will be my priority
The one that I am fixed upon


Refrain
Jesus, Jesus, yes I will follow
Jesus, Jesus in all I do
Jesus, Jesus help me remember
That first of all comes You.


Vers 2
Yes, every choice, every step will be led by You
And yes, I will dare to live my faith
I'II think of You, ask myself what would Jesus do
My pride should never take Your place


Refrain
Jesus, Jesus, yes I will follow
Jesus, Jesus in all I do
Jesus, Jesus help me remember
That first of all comes You.
