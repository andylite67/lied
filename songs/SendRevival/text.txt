Vers 1
We're looking to your promise of old
That if we pray and humble ourselves
You will come and heal our land
You will come, You will come


Vers 2
We're looking to the promise You made
That if we turn and look to Your face
You will come and heal our land
You will come, You will come
to us.


Refrain
Lord send revival, start with me
For I am one of unclean lips
And my eyes have seen the King
Your glory I have glimpsed
Send revival, start with me
