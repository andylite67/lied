Open the eyes of my heart, Lord,
Open the eyes of my heart;
I want to see You,
I want to see You.
(2x)


To see You high and lifted up,
shining in the light of Your glory.
Pour out your power and love;
As we sing: holy, holy, holy.


Holy, holy, holy,
holy, holy, holy,
holy, holy, holy,
I want to see You.
