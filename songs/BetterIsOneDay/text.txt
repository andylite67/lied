Vers 1
How lovely is Your dwelling place,
oh Lord, Almighty
My soul longs and even faints for You
For here my heart is satisfied,
within Your presence
I sing beneath the shadow of Your wings.


Refrain
Better is one day in Your courts
Better is one day in Your house
Better is one day in Your courts
Than thousand else where
One thing I ask and I would seek,
to see Your beauty
To find You in the place Your glory dwells.


Vers 2
My heart and flesh cry out,
for You the living God
Your spirit's water for my soul
I've tasted and I've seen,
come once again to me
I will draw near to You
I will draw near to You.


Refrain
Better is one day in Your courts
Better is one day in Your house
Better is one day in Your courts
Than thousand else where
One thing I ask and I would seek,
to see Your beauty
To find You in the place Your glory dwells.
