Fear not, for I´m with you,
fear not, for I´m with you,
fear not, for I´m with you,
says the Lord.
(2x)


I have redeemed you, I´ve called you by name,
child, you are mine;
when you walk through the waters,
I´ll be there, and through the flame;
you´ll not (no way!) be drowned,
you´ll not (no way!) be burned,
for I am with you.


Fear not, for I´m with you,
fear not, for I´m with you,
fear not, for I´m with you,
says the Lord.
(2x)


I have redeemed you, I´ve called you by name,
child, you are mine;
when you walk through the waters,
I´ll be there, and through the flame;
you´ll not (no way!) be drowned,
you´ll not (no way!) be burned,
for I am with you.



<s:70>Fear not!
