Lord, You have my heart,
and I will search for Yours;
Jesus, take my life and lead me on.
Lord, You have my heart,
and I will search for Yours,
let me be to You a sacrifice.


<i>(M) And I will praise You, Lord.
(F) I will praise you.
<i>(M) And I will sing of love come down.
(F) I will sing of love come down.
<i>(M) And as You show Your face,
(F) Show Your face.
(A) We´ll see Your glory here.
