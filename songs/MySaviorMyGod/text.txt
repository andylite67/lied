I am not skilled to understand
What God has willed, what God has planned
I only know at his right hand.
Stands one who is my savior.

Christ died to save me this I read
And in my heart I find a need
For him to be my savior

An come for sinful man to die
You count it strange, so once did I
Before I knew my savior

My God he was, My God he is
My God he큦 always gonna be

My strength, my solace
from this spring
That he who lives to be my king
Once died to be my savior

An come for sinful man to die
You count it strange, so once did I
Before I knew my savior

My savior큦 always there for me
My God he was, My God he is
My God he큦 always gonna be
(2x)
