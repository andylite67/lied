Vers 1
Wonderful so wonderful is Your unfailing love
Your cross has spoken mercy over me
No eye has seen, no ear has heard,
no heart can fully know
How glorious, how beautiful You are


Refrain
Beautiful one I love
Beautiful one I adore
Beautiful one my soul must sing.


Vers 2
Powerful so powerful Your glory fills the skies
Your mighty works displayed for all to see
The beauty of Your majesty
awakes my heart to sing
How marvelous, how wonderful You are.


Refrain
Beautiful one I love
Beautiful one I adore
Beautiful one my soul must sing.


Bridge
You opened my eyes to Your wonders anew
You captured my heart with this love
‘Cause nothing on earth is as beautiful as You
(2x)
